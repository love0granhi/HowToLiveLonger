These are some of the ways to watch Perfume: The Story of a Murderer in Hindi for free online. However, these methods are not legal or authorized by the filmmakers or distributors. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse them. We suggest that you watch the film in its original language with subtitles or wait for an official Hindi dubbed version to be released.
  
The film is not only a visual feast, but also a musical one. The score, composed by Tykwer and his collaborators Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek, is haunting and atmospheric, blending classical and modern elements. The music reflects Grenouille's emotions and moods, as well as the themes of the film, such as obsession, beauty, and death.
 
The film also explores the philosophical and moral implications of Grenouille's actions and motivations. He is a complex and ambiguous character, who can be seen as both a victim and a villain, a genius and a monster, a human and an animal. He is driven by a pure and innocent desire to capture the essence of life, but he does so by destroying it. He is alienated from society and himself, unable to love or be loved. He is a paradox: a man without a scent who creates the most sublime scents.
 
The film's ending is controversial and shocking, but also fitting and poetic. It shows the ultimate fate of Grenouille and his creation, as well as the reaction of the people who encounter it. It raises questions about the nature of beauty, art, and humanity, and leaves the viewer with a sense of wonder and horror.
